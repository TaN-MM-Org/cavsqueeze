# Changelog

## 1.10.0 (2026-09-05)

### Added

- `oat_closed_form`: exact unitary one-axis-twisting moments
  (Kitagawa and Ueda, Phys. Rev. A 47, 5138 (1993)) for N spin-1/2
  particles -- mean spin, extremal transverse variances
  V(+/-) = N/4 + N(N-1)/16 [A +/- sqrt(A^2+B^2)], the optimal
  squeezing angle, and both squeezing parameters. Every returned
  quantity is asserted against brute-force exact unitary evolution
  (QuTiP) for even and odd N at random twisting angles, to 1e-12;
  the mu = 0 coherent-state limit is exact. This is the
  decoherence-free benchmark the dissipative cumulant solver is
  measured against, not a substitute for it.

### Changed

- The pulse-sequence layer is now exported at the package root:
  `css_x`, `twist`, `twist_imperfect`, `pulse`, `squeezing_after`,
  `squeezing_trace`, `optimal_squeezing`, `ramsey_cumulant`,
  `ramsey_meanfield`, `twist_untwist`, `plain_squeezed_readout`
  (previously importable only from `cavsqueeze.protocols`).
- CI matrix: Python 3.10, 3.11, 3.12, 3.13.
- CHANGELOG.md added.
